# Rockway Robotics 2023
This is the main repository for the Robot code for our 2023 FIRST season.

## Setup
You will need to install the WPILIB libraries as well as their version of VSCode. They provide a  [WPILib Installer](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html) with instructions. It will work on **Linux**, **Windows**, and **macOS**.
You can configure the VSCode version like any normal VSCode set up, and use it to build and test the Java code.

However, in order to control the Robot you'll need to download the [FRC Driver Station](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/frc-game-tools.html), which currently only runs on **Windows**.
